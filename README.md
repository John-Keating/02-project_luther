#### N.B.: I am still editing the files and notes to make them more readible. It's a bit messy at the moment.

Project Luther is the second project in the [Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com) syllabus. I presented the project to the class on Friday, October 9, 2015.

### Goals of the project
- Linear Regression
- Webscraping
- Greater familiarity with the Pandas module
- Learn and use the different plotting functions

### Motivation
A great many films made outside of the US from established centers such as Bollywood and Pinewood Studios and recent entrants to the international film scene like mainland China and Nollywood. Most foreign produced films have a tough time breaking the U.S. box office, but successes like _Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon_ and _Amelie_ demonstrate an appetite for foreign films among American film-goers.

If a reasonably accurate model could predict the success of a foreign language film in the US, then it would be possible to select and distribute films that may be overlooked.
