# Project Luther, design draft

### Question/need:
There are a great many films made outside of the US from established centers
such as Bollywood and Pinewood Studios, to resent entries like China and Nollywood. Most
foreign produced films have a tough time breaking the U.S. box office, though
recent successes like *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* and *Amelie* demonstrate
an appetite for foreign films among American film-goers. 

We are a small film distribution company that would like to buy the rights to
 distribute foreign films in the U.S. Based on past box office performance of
foreign-produced films in the U.S., we would like a model to predict the potential success of a given foreign film.

### Description of sample movies and/or other data:
Using the information available in [Box Office Mojo](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=foreign.htm), produce a model that will help us narrow the field of potential candidates. Feel free to include other sources, such as mentions in the film press or on social media if it improves the performance of your model. We are particularly interested in the role played by international award ceremonies prior to U.S. release.

### Characteristics of each movie and/or other entities:
Please consider:
* Country of origin
* The success of previous films from that country
* The fame of the director
* The celebrity of the stars
* Critical rating 
* The performance of the film outside of the U.S.
* Awards
